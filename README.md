&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 2

    1901042643_HW2.cpp => Add Load/Save system with file, function that takes a parameter by
                          reference and a constant parameter by reference, function that uses
                          default arguments, auto statement and one declrtype statement, C++11
                          Enum types, All the errors should be printed to cerr object and all
                          the other text should be sent to cout.

&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 3

    1901042643_HW3.cpp => Hex program in C++ using object oriented techniques. Now you can play
                          more than one game at the same time. Comparing games, knowledge about
                          marked cells and query for size of game added.

&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 4

    1901042643_HW4.cpp => Hex program in C++ of HW3 using dynamic memory techniques and operator overloading.
    

&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 5

    1901042643_HW5.cpp => Design and implementation of a class hierarchy for the Board class of the NPuzzle problem.
                          Hex game with Abstract class AbstractHex and its 2 concrete classes HexVector uses STL vectors
                          and HexArray1D uses 1D array, 1 template class HexAdapter can be any STL class with a random
                          access iterator. global function that takes an array of AbstractHex pointers and returns true
                          if the array contains a valid sequence of moves for a game

&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 6

    1901042643_HW6.java => Implementation of Java Collections library using simple arrays. Javadoc included.

&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 7

    1901042643_HW7.java => Hex game in Java with a GUI.
                           Uses grid layout, JButtons for each cell, Radio and
                           Chekbox buttons for player options, TextField inputs will be for board size, Jbuttons
                           for game reset, load and save games, button for single step undo, HexGame Interface
                           that defines all methods, properly overridden clone method
