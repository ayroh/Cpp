&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 2

    1901042643_HW2.cpp => Add Load/Save system with file, function that takes a parameter by
                          reference and a constant parameter by reference, function that uses
                          default arguments, auto statement and one declrtype statement, C++11
                          Enum types, All the errors should be printed to cerr object and all
                          the other text should be sent to cout.
                      
Save File Example:

&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 3

    1901042643_HW3.cpp => Hex program in C++ using object oriented techniques. Now you can play
                          more than one game at the same time. Comparing games, knowledge about
                          marked cells and query for size of game added.

&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 4

    1901042643_HW4.cpp => Hex program in C++ of HW3 using dynamic memory techniques and operator overloading.
    

&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 5

    1901042643_HW5.cpp => Design and implementation of a class hierarchy for the Board class of the NPuzzle problem.
                          Hex game with Abstract class AbstractHex and its 2 concrete classes HexVector uses STL vectors
                          and HexArray1D uses 1D array, 1 template class HexAdapter can be any STL class with a random
                          access iterator. global function that takes an array of AbstractHex pointers and returns true
                          if the array contains a valid sequence of moves for a game
